# Banking-ap

Android app which allows user to manage and keep track of his personal transactions and spendings. It shows a list of all transactions on the homepage, filtered by month and type of transaction. Transactions can be sorted by price, title or date. Different types of transactions have different impacts on overall budget. The app allows CRUD operations on transactions, both in online and offline mode, as it uses API while in online mode and local database in offline mode. There are limits for the budget which are editable. The user can see graphically represented statistics for transactions in a chosen period of time, which is implemented using external library for graphic representation of data.
